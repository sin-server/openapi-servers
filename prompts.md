# Open WebUI Tool Servers Documentation

We're working on Open WebUI Tool servers, specifically how to get them all running from one docker compose file.

I've attached the filesystem server folder as well as the compose file. We're going to document how this server is built, and what Open WebUI requires, and then go to the next folder in this project until we;ve completed them all. At the end, we should have a clear workflow on how to add new servers to this system so when I add my chat.py, or Python Interpreter script, it can be able to perfectly execute the task of adding a server from scratch, or from a github repo.

Let's begin by analyzing this file and breaking it down.

is chat.py started with autorestart with an exposed port? Go through tthis whole project and create a detailed checklist that im able to watch for you edit as you go.
